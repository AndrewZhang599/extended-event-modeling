149 tracked videos

148 depth videos
	-> 148 objhand video -> slightly different due to intersection
miss (1.3.2 lack depth and 3.3.7 lack video)

149 skel videos -> identical

149 appear videos -> identical

149 optical videos -> slightly different in sizes (different video reader)

147 preprocessed videos (running from 148 objhand_complete).
skeleton for 4.4.6 were outliers in all timestamps, after masking there were virtually no data at all.

PCA: after filtering out defective skeleton videos, we end up with 148 - 16 = 132 videos.
Running PCA from 131 videos because one video that has total of 181 timestamps (majority are outliers) ->
may filter using #timestamps as well.
