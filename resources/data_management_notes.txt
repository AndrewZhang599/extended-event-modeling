149 tracked videos

148 depth videos
	-> 148 objhand video -> slightly different due to intersection
miss (1.3.2 lack depth and 3.3.7 lack video)

149 skel videos -> identical

149 appear videos -> identical

149 optical videos -> slightly different in sizes (different video reader)

147 preprocessed videos (running from 148 objhand_complete).
skeleton for 4.4.6 were outliers in all timestamps, after masking there were virtually no data at all.

PCA: after filtering out defective skeleton videos, we end up with 148 - 16 = 132 videos.
Running PCA from 131 videos because one video that has total of 181 timestamps (majority are outliers) ->
may filter using #timestamps as well.

tracking:
*C1*.csv and *C2*.csv on OSF were uploaded from ../extended-event-modeling-bk/extended-event-modeling/output/tracking_all/
*kinect*.csv on OSF were uploaded from extended-event-modeling/output/tracking/ (which is currently used by SEM)
TODO: visualize tracking results for C1 and C2

SEM features:
output/preprocessed_features/*.pkl were downloaded from the cluster on 2022-12-14 (the features were created in 2022-09) and uploaded to OSF at: https://osf.io/e3zwc/.
PCA components for each feature type were computed from these features for videos that passed the filtering criteria.
PCA components were uploaded to the same OSF folder.
A helper class in README.md (output/preprocessed_features/README.md) to load preprocessed features and perform PCA.
This class is from src/preprocess_features/compute_pca_all_runs.py.

data/small_videos/*: Tan moved most of the videos from local to Box (Box\DCL_ARCHIVE\Documents\Events\exp148_Corpus\data_from_tan_laptop) to free space, there are copies in the cluster as well.
data/clean_skeleton_data/*: same with above
output/tracking/*: Tan deleted local copies to free space, there are copies in the cluster and these were uploaded to Box (Box\DCL_ARCHIVE\Documents\Events\exp148_Corpus\data_from_tan_laptop) as well.

OSF files and README for META project is updated with sep_09 file format!

Tan moved Research folder to Box: Box\DCL_ARCHIVE\Documents\Tan\Research. Tan checked the new Research folder with remote cluster, they're synced!
A snapshot is backed up in: Box\DCL_ARCHIVE\Documents\Tan\Research-bk-12-22-22
Now SEM development can be done on multiple computers!
